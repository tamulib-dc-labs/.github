## 💼 What We Do

The Digital Collections Department at Texas A&M University Libraries stewards the university’s institutional repository, cultural heritage collections, digital exhibits, and open access journals.

We help faculty, students, and researchers share, publish, and preserve their work openly and ethically, supporting the principles of open scholarship and long-term access.

Our work also connects people with the university’s rich digital resources by helping audiences discover, explore, and engage with Texas A&M’s collections in new and meaningful ways.
